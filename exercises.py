# / learn python by writing functions!
#
# each exercise will challenge you to write a function that does some work and (usually) returns something useful
# if you don't know the answer already, the words you'll need to search in google are ALWAYS in the description!
#
# the test runner will not test anything you output that is falsy (functions are truthy)
# so just replace the null with your function and KILL EM ALL!
#
# be careful not to change the function names (the test runner only knows to look for the names given)

# PRINTING TO THE SCREEN

# To pass this test, all we need to do is print something to the command line in this function
def printer():
    pass

# To pass this test, return something
def declarer():
    pass

# Now make sure you're returning a string
def stringer():
    pass

# Print something out and return it too
def printAndReturn():
    pass

# STRINGS

# convert input to all uppercase
# example input: 'blah'
# example output: 'BLAH'
def capslocker():
    pass

# put two strings together (concatenate) in the order they're passed into the function
# example input: 'Life is', ' so wonderful'
# example output: 'Life is so wonderful'
def twoStringAdd():
    pass

# same as beforeu
def allStringAdd():
    pass
