# / learn python by writing functions!
#
# each exercise will challenge you to write a function that does some work and (usually) returns something useful
# if you don't know the answer already, the words you'll need to search in google are ALWAYS in the description!
#
# the test runner will not test anything you output that is falsy (functions are truthy)
# so just replace the pass with your function and KILL EM ALL!
#
# be careful not to change the function names (the test runner only knows to look for the names given)

# Todo stuff: creating, writing, and reading files, kwargs
# if I got really serious I could put in some numpy/pandas stuff and/or some requests

# Some potentially helpful imports:
import math

# PRINTING TO THE SCREEN

# To pass this test, all we need to do is print something to the command line in this function
def printer():
    pass

# To pass this test, return something
def declarer():
    pass

# Now make sure you're returning a string
def stringer():
    pass

# Print something out and return it too
def printAndReturn():

# STRINGS

# convert input to all uppercase
# example input: 'blah'
# example output: 'BLAH'
def capslocker():
    pass

# put two strings together (concatenate) in the order they're passed into the function
# example input: 'Life is', ' so wonderful'
# example output: 'Life is so wonderful'

# same as before, but the function must add however many strings are passed in
# example input: 'Life', ' is', ' so', 'wonderful'
# example output: 'Life is so wonderful'
def allStringAdd():
    pass

# this function should take two strings as input
# and return True when the first contains the second
# (and False in any other case)
# example input: 'funkadelic', 'funk'
# example output: True
# example input: 'parliament', 'funk'
# example output: False
def stringContains():
    pass

# similar to the above, but this function should return how many times
# the second string is contained in the first
# example input: 'blah blah blah monkey', 'blah'
# example output: 3
def instancesInString():
    pass

# this function receives a list of strings and makes one string out of them
# example input: (['Writing', 'Python', 'makes', 'me', 'hungry.'])
# example output: 'Writing Python makes me hungry.'
# note: the function should put a space between words, but not before the first
# word, nor after the last
# if you're stuck, search 'python3 join()'
def joinWords():
    pass

# this function should take a sentence (space separated words) and a list of
# words to censor, and return a new string with the words removed (not replaced
# with &*#@ or the like)
# example input: 'I am a great moron', ['a', 'moron']
# example output: 'I am great'
def censorSentence():
    pass

# take a string and split it into a list of each character
# you should take a look at the 'list()' function
# example input: 'Hi there, how are you?'
# example output: ['H', 'i', ' ', 't', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'e', ',', ' ', 'h', 'o', 'w', ' ', 'a', 'r', 'e', ' ', 'y', 'o', 'u', '?']

# BINARY, HEX, OCT AND DECIMAL

# convert a normal base 10 number to hexadecimal (the hex should be in a string)
# example input: 1234
# example output: '0x4d2'
def decToHex():
    pass

# now go from a hexadecimal (base 16) to a normal base 10 (decimal)
# note that the hex is going in as a string
# example input: '0x4d2'
# example output: 1234
def hexToDec():
    pass

# next we'll work on binary - this one should convert a normal int into binary
# note again that the binary is in a string
# example input: 123
# example output: '0b1111011'
def decToBinary():
    pass

# and now back the other way - from binary to dec
def binaryToDec():
    pass

# octals (base 8) aren't so widely used, but do still come up, and like hex and
# binary, Python recognizes them, so now we'll mix it up using octs
# this function should take a binary string ('0b101', for example) and return an oct
# example input: '0b1111011'
# example output: '0o173'
def binaryToOct():
    pass

# now we'll go from octal to hexadecimal
# example input: '0o777'

# UTF-8 ENCODING

'''
Introduction: Deep down, the only thing your computer truly undertands are 0s and 1s.
The deep down of your computer is essentially a whole lot of really teeny tiny light
switches. For each light switch 0 == off, and 1 == on. Each 'on' or 'off' is called
a bit. 8 bits (as to say, 8 0s and/or 1s) are 1 byte.

We just saw above that we can do math with 0s and 1s - those are the binary numbers
above. This section is to teach about writing with numbers. We use a code in which
binary numbers represent letters (and punctuation, spaces, etc.). There are a bunch
of encodings, but UTF-8 is the most common/important, so we'll be looking at it.

Put a different way, every character (letter, etc.) that can be put in string (such
as this one) on a deeper level is represented by a number. We'll be playing around
with those numbers now.

# example output: {1,2,3,4,5,6}
def setIntersection():

# like lists, sets also have comprehensions (one liners), but the syntax is
# different - look it up
# this function should contain a comprehension, along with using both the union
# and intersection operators (you may have used update() and intersection_update()
# for the last couple of exercises, but here you should be using the operators)
def setComprehension():
    pass

# we've seen that sets are mutable - that means we can change them around (like
# change values, or add and drop values), but there's a way to freeze a set
# and make it immutable (unchangeable) see if you can find out what it is
# the function should take a set as an argument

# TUPLES

# tuples are yet another way to store values in Python, but once made, the contents
# can't be changed once created
# while lists use [] and sets {}, tuples will use ()
# like we saw with sets, there are some catches in using the various built-ins
# Python gives us for tuples - this comes from () being used for some other things
# besides sets too (much like {} is also used for dicts, as we'll see later)

# zipping takes any two 'collections': lists, sets, even other tuples of the same
# length, and combines them into pairs of tuples by putting the first of each
# element together in a tuple pair, followed by a tuple pair of the second element
# and so on
# given two collections (as arguments), return the zip wrapped in a list
# bonus: play around with zip() on the command line, and figure out why you should wrap it in a list
# can you figure out how to accomplish this using a list comprehension?
# example input: [1,2,3], {'a','b','c'}
# example output: [(1,'c'),(2,'b'),(3,'a')]
def getZip():
    pass

# we've seen comprehensions for lists and sets - there are also tuple comprehensions
# they're made by calling a function, as with sets (you can't just use parentheses)
# look up what happens if you do try some thing like (x*2 for x in [1,2,3,4]) - it
# does compile, but it doesn't make a tuple, it makes a generator
